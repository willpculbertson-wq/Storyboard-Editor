# Changelog

## 2026-05-10 — Project initialized

- Created `storyboard-editor-prd.md` with full product requirements for v1
- Created `CLAUDE.md` with standing session instructions
- Created `CHANGELOG.md` (this file)
- Built initial `index.html` with full v1 feature set (start screen, image grid, scene editor panel, character manager, filters, bulk actions, export, stats, auto-save, lazy loading, drag-and-drop reorder, background SHA-256 hashing, IndexedDB handle persistence)
- **Known gap from PRD:** folder scanning is flat (top-level only); recursive subdirectory scanning, correct `asset.path` storage, and subfolder-based initial ordering are not yet implemented — planned for next session

## 2026-05-10 — Recursive scanning, path-keyed caches, batch edit

- Replaced flat folder scan with recursive `walkDir()` that walks the full directory tree via `for await...of handle.entries()`
- `asset.path` now stores the correct relative path from the folder root (e.g. `01-chapter/img001.jpg`); was previously just the filename
- `fileHandleCache` and `thumbnailCache` now keyed by `asset.path` instead of `asset.filename` — prevents collisions when the same filename appears in different subdirectories
- `reconcileScenes()` now matches existing scenes by `asset.path` (was matching by filename)
- All modules (LazyLoader, Editor, Hasher) updated to use `scene.asset.path` for cache lookups
- Editor panel now displays full `asset.path`; card hover tooltip also shows `asset.path`
- Initial scene ordering: root-level files first, then subdirectories sorted by `localeCompare({numeric:true})`, then filename within each directory
- `IMG_EXTS` trimmed to exactly the five PRD-specified extensions: `.jpg .jpeg .png .webp .gif`
- Added `App.BatchEdit` module — dialog with two-pane layout: folder scope (per-subdirectory checkboxes + "All scenes" master) and field selection (status, content rating, shot type, transition, perspective)
- Batch edit field dropdowns require an active user selection; placeholder is disabled so no value is applied silently
- Perspective field supports a `__clear__` sentinel to explicitly blank the POV character for selected scenes
- Apply button shows a confirmation prompt with the affected scene count before mutating project state
- "Batch Edit" button added to the app header
